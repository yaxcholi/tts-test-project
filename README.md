# tts-test-project
How to use: (Python)
1) Install python 3.9 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/
2) Install the required libraries (voicevox-client) is the most important one
3) When using this script you must have voicevox engine running for TTS: https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp
4) Play around with whatever settings you like, there are speakers 1-8 you can choose as of now.

If you're using this for Discord I highly recommend you install a virtual audio cable to work with as mic input
and make sure your echo cancellation is off so it doesn't mess with the tts

Also if you are trying to run this script in vscode you might encounter some issues with the gui not loading at all so just run it in shell if you will...

Please note if you try to put in any english text itll sound awful, this is meant for japanese only
